# Repo Info

The application is made in 2 versions, there is a next js version and there is a vue js version, the vue js version for me is an experiment and the vue js version has fewer features than the next js version.

## Tech Stack and Development

The repository is a monorepo that is set up using [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

The repository explorer application is located in the apps/next js folder.

UI components and other shareable packages are located in the packages folder.

The main technologies and libraries used for developing this application are:

- Next JS
- TypeScript
- Styling using Tailwind CSS, assisted by clsx and [cva](https://www.npmjs.com/package/class-variance-authority).
- In addition to Tailwind CSS, other UI libraries such as [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) and [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) are utilized to create accessible UI components. Both are unstyled headless libraries.
- Client state management is handled using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).
- API requests and server state management are handled using a combination of axios and [react query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/).
- For UI components that handle only styling and presentation, they are developed in an isolated manner in the packages/ui folder using [ladle](https://ladle.dev/), which is an alternative to [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) that is lighter and based on Vite.
- Testing is done using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
  - Unit testing for packages/ui is done using Cypress [component testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview).
  - Integration testing for apps/nextjs is done using [cypress e2e testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test).
- The application is a PWA (Progressive Web App) and is implemented using [next-pwa](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa).
- There are also [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (CI) for running tests and builds, which can be checked in the .github folder.
- Eslint and Prettier are used for code linting and formatting.
- Husky is used for pre-commit hooks.
- Animations are implemented using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
